### What is Acycle

Time-series analysis software for paleoclimate projects and education

Time series analysis plays a fundamental role in the natural sciences.

In growing important geoscience application, recognition and interpretation of climate signals in proxy records can be time consuming and subjective. Three reasons motivated the development of the Acycle time series analysis program: 

(1) There is a need to broaden and encourage the experience of time series analysis in the geosciences, especially in paleoclimatology and cyclostratigraphy. 

(2) There is a need to speed the process for the time-series analysis steps, which can be very time-consuming. 

(3) There is a need to provide objective methods for the analysis of paleoclimate signals as reproducibility becomes a major challenge.

Acycle is a comprehensive, but simple-to-use software package for analysis of time-series designed for paleoclimate research and education. 

Acycle runs either in the MATLAB environment or as a stand-alone application on Windows and Macintosh OS. 

It is an open-source package and is available free of charge.

Acycle v2.1 was developed in MatLab version 2019a. It was tested in the Mac OS Mojave (10.14) and Catalina (10.15), and Windows 7 and 10.

#### 1. MatLab version

This version works with both Mac OS and Windows. MatLab is essential for the Acycle software package. Specified MatLab toolboxes may be needed.

#### 2. Mac version

This software is a stand-alone program. It was tested in the Mac OS Mojave (10.14) and Catalina (10.15). If the Mac runs with no MatLab, MatLab runtime 2019a is essential for the Acycle stand-alone software.

AcycleX.X-Mac-green: No installation needed.  Size: ~100 Mb.

MatLab Runtime 2019a is not included in this package and can be downloaded at: https://www.mathworks.com/products/compiler/matlab-runtime.html.

#### 3. Windows version

This software is a stand-alone program. It was tested in Windows 10 and 7.

v1. AcycleX.X-Win-green

v2. AcycleX.X-Win-Installer

Size: ~100 Mb.

If the computer runs with no MatLab 2019a, MatLab Runtime R2019a is essential for the Acycle stand-alone software.

MatLab Runtime 2019a is not included in this package and can be downloaded at: https://www.mathworks.com/products/compiler/matlab-runtime.html.

Facts for stand-alone versions of Acycle:

* If you have MatLab 2019a, MatLab Runtime 2019a is already installed
* Stand-alone versions of Acycle only needs Runtime, not MatLab
* MatLab Runtime is not MATLAB
* MatLab Runtime is free
* Use MatLab Runtime 2019a; other versions of runtime may NOT work


### Examples



### What they say

#### Dr. J. Fred Read (Virginia Tech, USA)

I am writing to express my appreciation for all the hard work and thought that has gone into the development of the Acycle software program. It is truly an amazing contribution to the geosciences community. As someone who has spent much of the last 50 years trying to understand cyclic carbonates on shallow platforms, and having been involved with my students in some of the early work on stratigraphic modelling of the effects of Milankovitch forcing of carbonate platform stratigraphy, I was blown away by the power of the Acycle software.

In the old days we used in house programs from our geophysicist Cahit Coruh, and recently I have used Analyseries, kSpectra and Timefrq43, moving from Dos to Windows to Mac, jumping from one to the other to get the job done. Acycle has done away with the need for this, and I have been impressed with how very user friendly the program is – an indication of the tremendous effort and thought that has gone into putting this together.

You should all feel very proud of this contribution. It opens up much needed access to these powerful tools for a wide audience in the sedimentary geology and paleoclimate community. Thanks again for all your efforts. A really marvellous job.

#### Dr. James Ogg (Purdue University, USA)

"Mingsong Li's Acycle software enables us to quickly analyze the potential of new outcrops and boreholes, and then to determine the sedimentation rates and elapsed time. His Acycle software will become the standard tool for time-scale applications by all international workers."

#### Dr. Paul E. Olsen (Columbia University, USA)

"Not only is this software powerful and effective, it is also simple to use and therefore benefits researchers and at all levels within the paleoclimatology community, from novices to experts."

#### Dr. Marco Franceschi (University of Padova, Italy)

“Dr. Li’s software is being immensely valuable to my work. Some of the stratigraphic series I am studying display a prominent cyclicity, but were deposited in contexts characterized by relevant changes in sedimentation rates and often lack accurate geochronological constraints. Acycle has been designed specifically for dealing with similar cases, by tackling them with a rigorous statistical approach, and therefore is providing an invaluable tool for their investigation.”

#### Dr. Xu Yao (Lanzhou University, China)

“I am working on cyclostratigraphy and paleoclimate study of ancient strata and rocks (270 million years ago) with assistance from Acycle software. I also introduced this software to my colleagues whose research areas are paleoclimate implications of Quaternary loess (several thousand years ago). My colleagues have given me really good feedbacks about Acycle software.”

#### Dr. Christian Zeeden (IMCCE, Observatoire de Paris, France)

“Dr. Li’s software is novel and valuable in this context, especially because it facilitates the easy application of otherwise complex calculations.”

#### Dr. Arsenio Muñoz Jiménez (University of Zaragoza, Spain)

“Thank you very much and congratulations for the acycle software. I am using it and it is very very useful and interesting.”

#### Dr. Nicolas R. Thibault (University of Copenhagen, Denmark)

“I’ve been playing a lot with the excellent Acycle package for Matlab that Mingsong developed. Congratulations, this is a very nice interface that simplifies a lot our work and makes it truly faster to analyse a time-series.”

#### Dr. Frits Hilgen (Utrecht University, Netherlands)

"I used it this academic year for the first time in my MSc course on Astronomical climate forcing and time scales as replacement of the outdated Analyseries program. The main advantages of Acycle is that it is very user friendly, has a lot of different options for the statistical analysis of paleoclimate records and in addition first-rate plotting options. For instance you can directly see the trend that you aim to remove and then decide whether you want to continue with it. It is further also very good to see the fast and almost continuous improvement of Acycle, including the processing of reported bugs. And, not unimportantly, also my students were very enthusiastic about Acycle and I now use it now for my own research as well!"
