				<h5> 3D imaging & 3D particle tracking to answer material science questions</h5>
				<p>A large part of my work is dedicated to the improvement and maintenance of a multiplane wide-field setup at Hofkens Group in KULeuven. I am mostly using to investigate materials using super-resolution localization imaging and particle tracking in three dimensions. </p>

						<h3>Reptation of polymer chain, a three-dimensional view </h3>

				<h5 > Introduction </h5>
				<p>Bridging the gap between the micro- and macroscale requires appropriate models. Our current theoretical understanding of entangled polymer chain dynamics is based on the reptation model. First proposed by de Gennes (Nobel Prize of Physics, 1991) and further expanded by Doi and Edwards, the reptation model assumes that a polymer chain is confined by the surrounding matrix and is therefore forced to move inside an imaginary tube defined by the transient network of entangled neighboring chains.</p>
				<p>While reptation theory has proven to be a powerful tool, there are significant discrepancies between its predictions and the experimental results. These differences mainly arise because the model neglects the presence of cooperative network interactions â€“ differences in segment diffusion due to tube diameter variations and different local friction between monomer units and the matrix are ignored. While there is substantial interest in developing improved models, one of the limitations has been the difficulty in acquiring experimental data that can truly resolve the heterogeneity of polymer dynamics, preferably by avoiding ensemble averaging entirely and observing just a single chain.</p>
				<h5 > Reptation in 3D </h5>
				<p>We will image single polymer molecule chain on the multiplane setup. Hopefully revealing their motion and reptation behavior in three dimension. The motion will be compared to the ones predicted by the model. Influence of the size of the tube will also be investigated.</p>
